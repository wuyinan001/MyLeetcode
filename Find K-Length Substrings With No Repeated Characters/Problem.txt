Given a string s, return the number of substrings of length k with no repeated characters.

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "havefunonleetcode", k = 5
Output: 6
Explanation: 
There are 6 substrings they are : 'havef','avefu','vefun','efuno','etcod','tcode'.
Example 2:

Input: s = "home", k = 5
Output: 0
Explanation: 
Notice k can be larger than the length of s. In this case is not possible to find any substring.
 

Note:

1 <= s.length <= 104
All characters of s are lowercase English letters.
1 <= k <= 104
